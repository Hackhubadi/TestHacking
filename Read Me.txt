5. Click like or dislike on the application :)


Some quick tips:
If you get "account disable" message me.
If you get invalid credentials that means your accounts are fucked or you put in
the wrong password.
A good idea would not to over use this youtube bot for the
sake of your accounts getting banned and the bot being patched
... but I know that is a lost cause. 

Anyways enjoy!
